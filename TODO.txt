- Make an example of the learning: how the windows change the synaptic coupling

- Write about the STDP and IP results

- Check the integrals and constants of the learning windows.

- Write about rescaling the learning windows: difference between Carol-Cannon and Song (window parameters) and scaling of kempter window 

- Write about why there is a difference between the w_in and the w_out
