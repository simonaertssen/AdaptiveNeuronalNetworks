The synchronisation of networks of oscillators, network topology and network plasticity can only be understood from a holistic approach, and each domain is investigated in relation to the other. The Theta neuron model is analysed to understand feedback mechanisms between the frequency and phase response through the electrical current. Different network topologies are then described in terms of their degree distribution. Networks of Theta neurons are studied using the synchronisation of the mean-field. Inspired by the process of synaptic plasticity, learning rules are then established to observe emergent network topologies.
