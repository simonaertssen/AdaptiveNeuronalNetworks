\section{Mean Field Reductions}
\subsection{The Ott-Antonsen manifold for fully connected networks}
In \cite{OttAntonsen2008, OttAntonsen2009, OttAntonsen2010} a method was published to predict the dynamics of the order parameter \eqref{eq:orderparameter}. The exact \textsl{mean-field reduction} (\MFR) yields exact solutions to

\subsection{The Ott-Antonsen extension to arbitrary network topologies}
In \cite{OttAntonsen2017} the authors extended their work to include networks with arbitrary degree distributions.
